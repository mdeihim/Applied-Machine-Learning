My final pruned decision tree had slightly worse out-of sample accuracies than the neural networks, while the in-sample accuracies were almost the same. Comparing a few different 2 hidden layer network structures, the in-sample accuracy was the highest when the layers had 100 and 80 nodes respecitvely. The best out of sample accuracy was when the layers had 10 and 20 nodes respecitvely. The most accurate network structure that I tested had a single hidden layer with 15 nodes, which had in-sample and out of sample accuracies of about 82%."]}]}
